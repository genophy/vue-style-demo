                <p>
                    A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability
                    to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the
                    hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be
                    used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.

                    Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls,
                    factory devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design, and also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet
                    is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users.

                    Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices. Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the abacus aided people in doing calculations. Early in the Industrial
                    Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog
                    calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s
                    were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the
                    microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with MOS transistor counts increasing at a
                    rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.

                    Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)
                    microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically MOS semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a
                    sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output
                    devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be
                    retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.

                    Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally
                    stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains,
                    sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.[4][5] The use of counting rods is one example.


                    The Chinese suanpan (算盘). The number represented on this abacus is 6,302,715,408.
                    The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks. The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in Babylonia as early as 2400 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning
                    boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules,
                    as an aid to calculating sums of money.


                    The Antikythera mechanism, dating back to ancient Greece circa 150–100 BC, is an early analog computing device.
                    The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog "computer", according to Derek J. de Solla Price.[6] It was designed to calculate astronomical positions.
                    It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to c. 100 BC. Devices of a level of complexity
                    comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand years later.

                    Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use. The planisphere was a star chart invented by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the
                    early 11th century.[7] The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the
                    planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe
                    incorporating a mechanical calendar computer[8][9] and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235.[10] Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical
                    geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe,[11] an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine[12] with a gear train and gear-wheels,[13] c. 1000 AD.

                    The sector, a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots,
                    was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation.

                    The planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage.


                    A slide rule.
                    The slide rule was invented around 1620–1630, shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm. It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and
                    division. As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as transcendental functions such as
                    logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions. Slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations,
                    such as the E6B circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft.

                    In the 1770s, Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker, built a mechanical doll (automaton) that could write holding a quill pen. By switching the number and order of its internal
                    wheels different letters, and hence different messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be mechanically "programmed" to read instructions. Along with two other complex
                    machines, the doll is at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, and still operates.[14]

                    The tide-predicting machine invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically
                    calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.

                    The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In 1876,
                    Lord Kelvin had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators.[15] In a
                    differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines
                    to work. Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers.
